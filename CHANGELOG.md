  `ty` type checking, `deptry`, `zizmor`, `check-manifest`, and expanded
  pre-commit hooks (secrets/spelling/workflow-lint checks).
- Add CodeQL and OpenSSF Scorecard security-scanning workflows, issue/PR
  templates, and `CODEOWNERS`.

  type checker.

### Fixed

### Removed

- Remove the unused `rich` and `exceptiongroup` runtime dependencies.
