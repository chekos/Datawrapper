```

## Quick Start

Create beautiful charts with type-safe, object-oriented Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import datawrapper as dw

# Create a bar chart
chart = dw.BarChart(
    title="Top Programming Languages 2024",
    data=pd.DataFrame({"Language": ["Python", "JavaScript", "Java"], "Users": [45.3, 38.2, 30.5]}),
    axis_label_format=NumberFormat.ONE_DECIMAL,
    value_label_format=NumberFormat.ABBREVIATED,
)

# Create and publish (uses DATAWRAPPER_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable)
chart.create()
chart.publish()
```
See the [full documentation](https://datawrapper.readthedocs.io/) for comprehensive guides on all chart types.
