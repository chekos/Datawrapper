# datawrapper

A lightweight Python wrapper for the Datawrapper API

## Features

* Create, get, update, export and delete charts, tables and maps
* Add data from a `pandas.DataFrame` or a GeoJSON file with one simple call
* Get, update and delete folders, users and teams.
* Retrieve lists of recently edited and updated charts
* Access metadata about your account
* Get a list of all available themes

## Installation

```bash
uv install datawrapper
```

## Quick Start

Create beautiful charts with type-safe, object-oriented Python:

```python
from datawrapper.charts import BarChart, NumberFormat

# Create a bar chart with type-safe configuration
chart = BarChart(
    title="Top Programming Languages 2024",
    data={"Language": ["Python", "JavaScript", "Java"], "Users": [45.3, 38.2, 30.5]},
    axis_label_format=NumberFormat.ONE_DECIMAL,  # Type-safe enum
    value_label_format=NumberFormat.ABBREVIATED,  # IDE autocomplete support
)

# Create and publish (uses DATAWRAPPER_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable)
chart_id = chart.create()
chart.publish()
```

**Benefits of the OOP approach:**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Type safety** - Catch errors before runtime with Pydantic validation
- ðŸ’¡ **IDE autocomplete** - Discover available options as you type
- ðŸ“– **Readable code** - Use semantic enum names instead of cryptic format strings
- ðŸ”§ **Flexible** - Mix OOP with low-level API calls when needed

See the [full documentation](https://datawrapper.readthedocs.io/) for comprehensive guides on all chart types.
